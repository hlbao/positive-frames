I am stressed and thinking about lots of things at once, but I am going to focus on taking things one at a time.
 stopThe list of things I have to do today is forever long. I hope I am able to finish it on time.
 stopIf I don't have a mental breakdown before the end of summer, it will be a miracle.
 stopI just caught myself taking extra deep breaths as if it would somehow help Hallie breathe. I hope it does.
 stopI had a bad night last night, but this holiday is coming at the right time, so I'm going to enjoy it.
 stopChristmas shopping is hard and it even makes me a little sad because it makes me doubt how well I know my family. But I'm thankful that I have the ability to do it.
 stopIt's hard to get one day of alone time, of peace and quiet, but I'm sure I'll get it soon.
 stopAll this school work due in the next two days, and I haven't touched any of it. And work this week, and coaching to, but I'm sure I can finish it.
 stopTrying to find clothes for Emily that match in color and style is a challenge for me, but I'm sure I'll find the perfect one.
 stopI have a lot of revision to do, but I know I can finish it if I work hard enough.
